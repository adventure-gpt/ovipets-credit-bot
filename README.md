### Step 6: Monitoring and Control

#### A. Bot Status
- **Red dot**: Bot is stopped
- **Green dot**: Bot is running
- **Queue counter**: Shows how many eggs are queued for turning
- **Progress bar**: Shows collection progress

#### B. Safety Features
- **Peaceful Mode**: Only processes your own pets (safer)
- **Evil Mode**: Processes all species types (faster but riskier)
- **Auto-refresh**: Handles rate limiting automatically
- **Error recovery**: Restarts collection if errors occur

#### C. Stopping the Bot
1. Click "‚èπÔ∏è STOP" to stop any running bot
2. The status dot will turn red
3. All processing will halt

### Step 7: Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

**Bot panel doesn't appear**:
- Refresh the page
- Check that Tampermonkey script is enabled
- Make sure you're logged into Ovipets

**"Connection failed" errors**:
- Make sure the Python server is running
- Check that you see "Starting server on http://127.0.0.1:8000" in the terminal
- Try restarting the server

**AI predictions are wrong**:
- The AI has ~95% accuracy but isn't perfect
- Wrong predictions will be handled by the retry system
- If problems persist, check model files are in the `models` folder

**Bot gets stuck**:
- Click "‚èπÔ∏è STOP" and then "‚ñ∂Ô∏è START" to restart
- Check browser console (F12) for error messages
- Restart the Python server if needed

**Python environment issues**:
- Make sure Anaconda is installed correctly
- Try recreating the environment:
  ```bash
  conda env remove -n ovipetsbot
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```

#### Getting Help:
1. Check the browser console (press F12, click Console tab)
2. Look for error messages in red
3. Check the Python server window for error messages
4. Make sure all files are in the correct locations

### Step 8: Advanced Usage

#### A. Customizing Bot Behavior
- **Evil Mode**: Turn on for faster processing of all species
- **Peaceful Mode**: Turn on for safer operation (own pets only)
- **Batch Processing**: Bot can handle hundreds of eggs automatically

#### B. Multiple Modules
- You can run different modules simultaneously
- Each module has its own start/stop controls
- Use tabs to organize different bot functions

#### C. Performance Tips
- Keep the Python server running for best performance
- Use Evil Mode for maximum speed (but higher risk)
- Monitor the queue to see processing progress
- Close unnecessary browser tabs for better performance

## üîí Safety and Ethics

- **Use responsibly**: Don't overload the Ovipets servers
- **Respect rate limits**: The bot includes built-in delays
- **Monitor usage**: Keep an eye on the bot's activities
- **Follow game rules**: Make sure automation is allowed in your game's terms of service
